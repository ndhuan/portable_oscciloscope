/* The class Core::Root provides the base functionality for the entire GUI application. 
   Due to its ancestry, the application provides the entire set of functionality 
   implemented in the Core::Group class. It serves as the root container for all 
   GUI components, menus, panels, etc.
   The application also provides an interface to the underlying target system and 
   to the screen. The coordinate system of the application corresponds therefore 
   to the coordinate system of the screen. Every Embedded Wizard application needs 
   one application object.
   The interface of the Core::Root class provides several methods and properties 
   to control the application and to coordinate the screen update and the event 
   dispatching. For example:
   The property @Keyboard allows the management of virtual keyboard components. 
   A keyboard component is an ordinary GUI component you can design and fill e.g. 
   with buttons. Its job ist to generate keyboard events in response to other user 
   interaction events, like the touch event. For this purpose the application will 
   provide the virtual keyboard component with all necessary touch events before 
   these are passed to the remaining parts of the GUI. Additionally, the application 
   ensures that the virtual keyboard always remains visible on the top of the screen.
   - The methods @BeginAnimation() and @EndAnimation() allow you to temporarily 
   deactivate the handling of keyboard and mouse/touch panel events. This is useful 
   during animated screen transitions to avoid interferences with user interactions.
   - The methods @BeginModal() and @EndModal() are useful to temporarily limit the 
   event delivery to a particular component. In this manner the component will become 
   'modal'. The event delivery limitation ensures that the user will interact with 
   the given component only whereas the remaining GUI parts are not available. Modal 
   GUI components are very common in all GUI applications.
   - The methods @CaptureCursor(), @DeflectCursor() and @RetargetCursor() affect 
   the flow of touch events. They are used in special cases, when e.g. after receiving 
   a touch event the component needs to redirect the events to other component.
   - The methods @DriveCursorHitting(), @DriveCursorMovement(), @DriveMultiTouchHitting(), 
   @DriveMultiTouchMovement() and @DriveKeyboardHitting() are for the integration 
   purpose with the underlaying target system. You will never need to invoke these 
   methods from the GUI application. But if you are responsable for the integration 
   of the GUI application with your target system, you may need to feed these methods 
   with events from your touch screen or hardware keyboard.
   - The properties @Language and @Styles reflect the currently selected language 
   and the active styles. These may determine the visual aspect of the GUI application. 
   The properties cover the underlaying Chora variables 'language' and 'styles' 
   and broadcast Core::LanguageEvent or Core::StylesEvent in case of their modification. */

/* The method Draw() is invoked automatically if parts of the view should be redrawn 
   on the screen. This can occur when e.g. the view has been moved or the appearance 
   of the view has changed before.
   Draw() is invoked automatically by the framework, you never will need to invoke 
   this method directly. However you can request an invocation of this method by 
   calling the method InvalidateArea() of the views @Owner. Usually this is also 
   unnecessary unless you are developing your own view.
   The passed parameters determine the drawing destination aCanvas and the area 
   to redraw aClip in the coordinate space of the canvas. The parameter aOffset 
   contains the displacement between the origin of the views owner and the origin 
   of the canvas. You will need it to convert views coordinates into these of the 
   canvas.
   The parameter aOpacity contains the opacity descended from this view's @Owner. 
   It lies in range 0 .. 255. If the view implements its own 'Opacity', 'Color', 
   etc. properties, the Draw() method should calculate the resulting real opacity 
   by mixing the values of these properties with the one passed in aOpacity parameter.
   The parameter aBlend contains the blending mode descended from this view's @Owner. 
   It determines, whether the view should be drawn with alpha-blending active or 
   not. If aBlend is false, the outputs of the view should overwrite the corresponding 
   pixel in the drawing destination aCanvas. If aBlend is true, the outputs should 
   be mixed with the pixel already stored in aCanvas. For this purpose all Graphics 
   Engine functions provide a parameter to specify the mode for the respective drawing 
   operation. If the view implements its own 'Blend' property, the Draw() method 
   should calculate the resulting real blend mode by using logical AND operation 
   of the value of the property and the one passed in aBlend parameter. */

   permits the hierarchical event dispatching until a willing view has handled the 
   event or all views in the focus path have been evaluated. If the event remains 
   still unhandled, it will be passed to the component itself.
   The focus path is established by the property @Focus. 
   DispatchEvent() returns the value returned by the @HandleEvent() method of the

   method returns 'null'. */

   BroadcastEvent() is very useful to provide all views with one and the same event 
   in order e.g. to inform all views about an important global state alteration.
   BroadcastEvent() returns the value returned by the @HandleEvent() method of the 
   view which has handled the event. In the case, the event was not handled, the

   is positiv, the view will be elevated to the foreground. If aOrder == 0, no modification 
   will take place.
   The absolute value of aOrder determines the number of sibling views the view
